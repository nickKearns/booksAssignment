1: How would we filter for all books with titles containing the word ‘Django’?
- Book.objects.filter(name__contains='Django')
2: How would we filter for all books with tag ‘Fiction’?
- Book.objects.filter(tag__name='Fiction')
3: How would we filter for all authors who have written books containing the word ‘Django’? HINT: We can use the book field to refer to an author’s books, even though the Author model doesn’t explicitly contain it!
- Author.objects.filter(book__name__contains='Django')
